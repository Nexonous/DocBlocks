# Documentation

This is the main documentation repository for the documentation subdomain of Nexonous.

## Usage

This repository is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) so make sure you have it installed in your machine. Afterwards just run `npm start` to convert all the Markdown files to HTML files and they will be placed in the `/public` directory. For testing, just run the `npm test` command which will host a server at <http://localhost:8080> (or <http://127.0.0.1:8080>).
