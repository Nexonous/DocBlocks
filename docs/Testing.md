# Testing

The repository provides a testing server along with a testing directory which contains all the testing tools necessary. Run the `npm test` command to generate the output and serve them locally using a localhost server. To view the preview open up <http://localhost:8080> (or <http://127.0.0.1:8080>) in the browser.

Note that changing files in the `testing`, `template`, `src` and `docs` will restart the server (using [`nodemon`](https://nodemon.io/)).
